In order to use the web conversion tool, it is as simple as setting up a machine that you can host a website on, such as an Apache server. Then, you need to move the mergeconvert.cgi file into the hosting directory. The script requires read and execute permissions for everyone. This can be done by navigating to the directory with mergeconvert.cgi and running the following command:

chmod 755 mergeconvert.cgi

At that point, you should be able to load mergeconvert.cgi from a web browser, we recommend using Chrome (ver 56 or later) as that is what we used for testing. This is all that is required for installation.
